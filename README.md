## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- MUI Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Material UI Components](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - For UI
- [Carousel class](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel) - For making carousel

### What I learned

- learnt more about redux and redux toolkit, store, provider, redux-slice
- customizing carousel of bootstrap 5
- customizing Dialog component of material ui

### Useful resources

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [material UI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - This is the official documentation which helped me finally understand material ui components. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. Lots of Components that i used in this project like the responsive appbar with tabs and tab indicator, Dialog for image gallery view and many more. Its very useful in builing ui faster.
